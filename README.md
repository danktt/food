# HeroUI Native Example App

This is a React Native (Expo 54) project with [HeroUI Native](https://github.com/heroui-inc/heroui-native) - a modern UI library that provides beautiful and customizable components for React Native applications.

## Get started

1. Clone the repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/heroui-inc/heroui-native-example.git
   cd heroui-native-example
   ```

2. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

4. (Optional) Clean git history for a fresh start

   ```bash
   rm -rf .git
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   ```

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **src/app** directory. This project uses file-based routing with Expo Router.

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready to start with a clean slate, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the current **src** directory to **app-example-src** and create a new **src/app** directory with basic HeroUI Native setup where you can start developing.
